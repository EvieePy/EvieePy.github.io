Hey :heart: Welcome to my random blog! 

I wanted a space I could write and share posts about Python, Programming, Chronic Illness and other random stuff with people. 

Admittedly I spent little amount of time on designing this blog, as I often find myself with too many projects. I used [MultiTerm Astro](https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro) 
as the base and have tweaked things here and there. One day I may move everything over to a more personalised theme.

Anyway I hope you find some useful info, insight or enjoyment here :heart:
